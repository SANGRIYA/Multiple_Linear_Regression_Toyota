# Multiple_Linear_Regression_Toyota
The Multiple Linear Regression with the Toyota dataset in machine learning involves using a regression algorithm to analyze the relationship between multiple independent variables (such as car features like mileage, horsepower, etc.) and a dependent variable (typically the price of the car). This dataset likely contains various features of Toyota cars and their corresponding prices. The goal is to build a regression model that can predict the price of a Toyota car based on its features. Multiple Linear Regression is suitable for this task because it can handle multiple predictors simultaneously and quantify the impact of each variable on the target variable. By training the model on the Toyota dataset, it learns the relationship between the features and the car prices, allowing for accurate price predictions for new instances.
